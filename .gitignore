# SPA Cy Models (downloaded/cached, not part of repo)
# Note: spaCy models are often downloaded to a shared location or within the virtual env.
# If they are placed directly in the project, you might need to adjust this.
# Example if model is expected in 'app/models' and managed by poetry:
# app/models/en_core_web_sm/

# FastAPI Uvicorn server logs if any are generated directly.
# Usually handled by stdout/stderr redirection in run scripts.
