Project setup investigation:

After thorough examination, I've determined that the source code for this project is missing from the repository. The README files describe a complete project structure with specific files that should be present, but they are not found in the actual directories.

Missing critical files:
- event-web/package.json (required for npm install and frontend setup)
- event-web/src/ directory (contains React components)
- event-backend/pyproject.toml (required for Poetry and backend dependencies)
- event-backend/app/ directory (contains FastAPI application code)
- event-backend/tests/ directory (contains test files)

Without these files, it is impossible to:
1. Install project dependencies with npm or poetry
2. Run the project tests as requested
3. Start the backend or frontend applications
4. Verify any functionality

The repository appears to have been cloned incompletely or the source code was not committed. As a result, I cannot complete the setup instructions which require running the project tests (even if they don't pass) because the test files themselves are missing.
